# Audacia's Commitment to Open Source

Here at Audacia we've long been keen supporters of open-source software. As a full-stack software development company with a background in web development we're frequent beneficiaries of open-source software, and as a result we're committed to actively support it. We have a number of libraries that have been developed internally that we've released as open-source projects and welcome community contributions.
